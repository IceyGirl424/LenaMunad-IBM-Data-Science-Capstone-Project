# My IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project

Welcome to the culmination of my journey through the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. In this project, I acted as a data scientist hired by Space Y (a competitor company to Space X).

This project aimed to predict the successful first-stage landing of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets.  Leveraging historical launch data, I employed various techniques including data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations and SQL queries, interactive mapping with Folium, and Plotly Dash dashboards.  My findings identified key factors influencing landing success and established a machine learning model for future predictions.  This capability can empower stakeholders to estimate launch costs and potentially inform competitive bidding strategies.
